What is the Verkhovna Rada going to do in 2023 - our Oleksandr Salizhenko figured out: https://bit.ly/3VLm4hI 🔺 For the first time, the Verkhovna Rada has been working for a long time with restrictions on informing about its work: some information from the parliament's website has been removed for security reasons, videos of meetings are published after the fact, and the activities of committees are covered selectively. Obviously, such restrictions have negative consequences, and the different level of openness indicates the abuse and unwillingness of some committee chairmen to properly conduct their work. 🔺 For the first time in the Ukrainian parliament in the first months of full-scale aggression, there was an informal ""defense coalition"" of MPs from the government and the opposition, which initially demonstrated productive voting dynamics and a significant percentage of decision-making by the constitutional majority. However, the further the Ukrainian Armed Forces drove Russian troops from the capital, the more the parliament returned to the usual politicking and party confrontations. 🔺 For the first time, the Ukrainian parliament in the conditions of a full-scale war became a real platform for meetings of international delegations and speeches of world leaders, who often addressed Ukrainian MPs in Ukrainian and quoted Ukrainian classics.

In order for pedestrians to be more visible in the dark and not to become victims of road accidents, the SES advises to wear reflective elements (flickers) on their clothes. The distance from which a driver notices a pedestrian in black clothes is 20 meters, in light clothes - 50 meters, and in clothes with reflective elements - 130 meters. While on dry asphalt, the braking distance of a car moving at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour exceeds 20 meters. Reflective elements can be in the form of bracelets, ribbons on the arm or backpack, stickers, key chains and vests. But if everything is clear with vests, how to wear other elements correctly? ✅ Place reflectors on clothing at the level of the driver's vision; ✅ choose noticeable elements larger than 15 sq. cm; ✅ wear flickers on moving parts of the body - forearms, wrists, legs, ankles; ✅ attach key chains to bags that you carry in your right hand, moving towards the traffic flow; ✅ attach the badges anywhere on your outerwear; ✅ armbands can also be attached to the legs; ✅ combine removable and non-removable reflectors; ✅ keep in mind that the accessory should be visible from everywhere; ✅ be sure to use flickers if you ride a bike.

Heavy fighting is taking place on the borderline Svatove-Kreminna and in the direction of Lysychansk. The most difficult situation remains in the area of Soledar-Bakhmut-Mayorsk. There the enemy is actually trying to advance over their dead bodies, but the units of the Defense Forces are holding back the enemy offensive at the cost of extraordinary efforts. In the Donetsk sector we managed to hold positions around Avdiivka and continue counter-offensive actions. We are reliably holding the defensive lines in the Zaporizhzhia sector and are making efforts to protect Kherson, first of all civilians and critical infrastructure of the city, from enemy shelling.

I expressed gratitude to General Milley for the foreign-made anti-aircraft missile systems provided with his active assistance. Today, they save lives of civilians of Ukraine. We have also discussed the needs of the Defense Forces to continue the struggle against the aggressor.
